- fix layout of navbar when zooming
    > consistent rounding of corners
    > consistent space between icons
    > bar should still grow in vertical size when zooming

- fix layout of image screen when zooming
    > text size
    > image distortion at zoom levels above 100%

- clicking on image should reveal a full-screen viewer or something along those lines
